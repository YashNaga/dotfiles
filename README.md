# Dotfiles


> Setup

I use kanagawa themed colours for my entire setup, I use neovim for my IDE and text editor and I use sketchybar to display some vital information with a custom appearance. I deleted my old dotfiles while trying to learn git so these are my new ones

----

>Text editor / IDE

**Nvim** as my text editor and IDE and configured it myself   
**Package manager:** Lazy   

> Terminal

I recently switched from Iterm2 to kitty, mostly for convenience and secondly for its battery usage (for me personally kitty is better)

> Window manager

**Yabai:** as my window manager on mac and use i3 for my arch setup but that config isn't here yet as im trying to convert my yabai keybinds to i3

> Global keybinds

**Skhd:** to set global keymaps and I'm probably gonna use the equivalent for my arch setup

> Others

**Sketchybar:** for the bar at the top  
**Neofetch:** Just to display information everytime I open a terminal
**Oh-my-zsh:** using zsh as my shell on mac and arch
